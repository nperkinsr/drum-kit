# Drum kit
**Drum Kit** is an interactive project that lets users play a virtual drum set using either their mouse or keyboard. The screen displays seven buttons, each styled as a part of a drum kit (like a snare, bass, cymbal, etc.) and labelled with a letter.

Users can click on a drum button to hear its sound, or press the matching key on their keyboard — for example, pressing D will trigger the cymbal sound. This project was designed to practise working with audio elements, event listeners, and handling keyboard input.

It’s a hands-on way to learn how to trigger actions with both clicks and keystrokes, making the web projects feel more dynamic and responsive.
